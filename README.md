# TDA-for-Medical-Image-Analysis

This repository contains the codes to implement cubical persistence algorithm in TDA to extract topological features from chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia. Also included some analysis for breast ultrasound and fundus camera images for possible future research projects.

Dataset resource: PneumoniaMNIST from MedMNIST (https://medmnist.com)

In the files, there are codes for pipeline visualization for a sample image data, codes for constructing/generating cubical complexes from a sample image, codes for computation of cubical persistence/Persistence Diagrams and codes for some exploration on vectorization tools (computing Betti functions, persistence images and extracting meaningful feature vectors) We used Random Forest and Logistic Regression models to train the machine with these features to predict the diagnosis.
